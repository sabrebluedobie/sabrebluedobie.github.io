<h2>1. Keywords</h2>

<p>When it comes to web design, choosing the right keywords is crucial. <strong>Keywords are the backbone of SEO</strong>. They help search engines understand what your site is about and connect you with the right audience.</p>
<h3>Types of Keywords</h3>
<p>There are different types of keywords you should know about:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Informational Keywords</em>: These are used when someone is looking for information. Examples include 'How do I brand my website?' or 'Best Social Media Tools'. These are great for blog posts and guides.</li>
<li>Transactional Keywords: These are used when someone is ready to make a purchase. Examples include 'buy running shoes' or 'order pizza online'.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keyword Intent</h3>
<p>It's easy to take keywords at face value, but they can have many different meanings beneath the surface. The intent behind a search is important for your ranking potential. You need to be extra careful about how you interpret the keywords you target.</p>
<blockquote>
Assigning keywords to pages is essential. Make sure each page targets a specific keyword phrase. Think about how your reader might search for that specific page.
</blockquote>
<h3>Avoiding Keyword Cannibalization</h3>
<p>Keyword cannibalization happens when multiple pages on your site target the same keyword. This can confuse search engines and hurt your rankings. To avoid this, assign unique keywords to each page.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Understanding and using the right keywords can make a big difference in your site's SEO. Take the time to do proper <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/search-engine-optimization/trends/seo-keyword-research" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keyword research</a> and you'll see the benefits in your search rankings.</p>


<h2>2. Meta Tags</h2>

<p>Meta tags are small pieces of text that describe a page's content. They don't appear on the page itself but in the page's code. These tags help search engines understand what your page is about, which is <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/important-tags-seo/156440/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crucial for SEO success</a>.</p>
<h3>Title Tag</h3>
<p>The title tag is one of the most important meta tags. It tells search engines and users what the page is about. Make sure your title tag is clear and includes your main keyword. <strong>This is crucial for SEO success because they tell Google about the page's content in the most direct way.</strong></p>
<h3>Meta Description</h3>
<p>The meta description is a short summary of what the page is about. Think of it as your site's window display—a concise and appealing description of what is contained within, with the goal of encouraging people to enter. A good meta description will typically contain two full sentences. Search engines may not always use your meta description, but it is important to give them the option.</p>
<h3>Keyword Metadata</h3>
<p>Keyword metadata is rarely used these days by search engines, but it doesn't hurt to include a few relevant keywords. Just don't overdo it. A few well-chosen keywords can still be helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
Always review and update your meta tags as your site changes over time. This ensures that your metadata stays relevant and accurate.
</blockquote>


<h2>3. Alt Text</h2>

<p>Alt text is a short, but descriptive piece of text that explains the relationship between the image and your content. It helps search engines understand what your image is about and the context of how your image relates to your page, so <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing good alt</a> text is quite important. You can add this to your HTML with the alt attribute of the img element, or your CMS may have an easy way to specify a description for an image when you're uploading it to your site. Learn more about how to write good alt text, and how to add it to your images.</p>


<h2>4. Header Tags</h2>

<p>Header tags are like the signposts of your webpage. They help both users and search engines understand the structure and main points of your content. <strong>Using them correctly can boost your SEO</strong> and make your site easier to navigate.</p>
<h3>H1: The Main Title</h3>
<p>The H1 tag is usually the title of your page. It's the most important header tag and should clearly describe what the page is about. Think of it as the headline of a newspaper article.</p>
<h3>H2: Subheadings</h3>
<p>H2 tags are used for the main sections of your content. They break up your text into readable chunks and make it easier for users to find the information they need. For example, in this article, each main section like &quot;Keywords&quot; and &quot;Meta Tags&quot; is an H2.</p>
<h3>H3: Sub-Subheadings</h3>
<p>H3 tags are for smaller sections within your H2 sections. They provide more detail and help organize your content even further. If you have a lot of information under an H2, breaking it down with H3 tags can make it more digestible.</p>
<blockquote>
Remember, header tags play a role in SEO by enhancing user experience, providing context to search engines, and increasing the chances of securing featured snippets.
</blockquote>
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use only one H1 tag per page.</li>
<li>Use H2 tags for main sections and H3 tags for subsections.</li>
<li>Include <em>keywords</em> naturally in your header tags.</li>
<li>Keep your headers clear and descriptive.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can make your content more organized and improve your site's SEO.</p>


<h2>5. URL Structure</h2>

<p>Creating a good URL structure is key for both SEO and user experience. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-optimize-urls-for-search" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keep each URL as simple as possible</a>. This means avoiding unnecessary words and keeping it short. For example, compare these two URLs for an article about SEO tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.example.com/blog/seo-tools</li>
<li>https://www.example.com/blog/the-ultimate-list-of-the-best-seo-tools-2023</li>
</ul>
<p>The first URL is short and descriptive, and it includes the target keyword. The second URL is long and complex, and it includes unnecessary words. Which one is better for SEO and user experience? The first one.</p>
<h3>Plan Your Site Hierarchy</h3>
<p>Before you build your site, plan your site hierarchy to create a clear and simple navigation menu. Use a flat site architecture—meaning any page on your site should be reachable in four clicks or less.</p>
<h3>Use Directories Wisely</h3>
<p>Group topically similar pages in directories. This helps Google learn how often the URLs in individual directories change. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.example.com/policies/return-policy.html</li>
<li>https://www.example.com/pets/cats.html</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Internal Links</h3>
<p>Use internal links strategically to help users and search engines discover more of your content. This can also help with your site's navigation.</p>
<h3>Use Breadcrumbs</h3>
<p>Breadcrumbs help users find their way and easily explore your site. Google learns breadcrumbs automatically based on the words in the URL, but you can also influence them with structured data if you like a technical challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
A URL that only contains random identifiers is less helpful for users. For example, https://www.example.com/2/6772756D707920636174 is less useful than a URL with descriptive words.
</blockquote>
<h3>Use Sitemaps</h3>
<p>Use HTML and XML sitemaps to show search engines and people how the pages on your site are connected.</p>


<h2>6. Internal Links</h2>

<p>Internal links are links that point to other pages on your site. They help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a clear and logical site structure that Google and users love</li>
<li>Boost the authority and relevance of your pages with “link juice” (ranking power)</li>
<li>Increase user engagement and retention by providing more value and information</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.clearscope.io/blog/what-is-internal-linking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Internal linking is essential for SEO</a> because it helps distribute link value across a website, enhancing the SEO of important pages—and not just your homepage.</p>
<p>To quickly audit your site’s structure, head to the “Internal Linking” report in Site Audit. Resolve any errors, warnings, and issues as soon as you can to avoid hurting your site’s navigation.</p>

<h2>7. External Links</h2>

<p>External links are links on your site that point to other sites. They help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build credibility and trust by referencing other authoritative sources</li>
<li>Give readers additional value and context by directing them to related resources</li>
<li>Build relationships and reputation by showing other sites your appreciation and recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>But you shouldn’t just throw links around and hope for the best. Follow these best practices to use internal and external links effectively:</p>


<h2>8. Anchor Text</h2>

<img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 200px;" src="https://contenu.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/0e891605-36bd-4e75-8048-4055c576dfd3/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Anchor text illustration showing SEO boost in web design." >

<p><a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/anchor-text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anchor text is the clickable (often blue) text in a hyperlink. It's SEO best practice to write anchor link text that's descriptive and relevant to the page you're linking to.</a> This helps both users and search engines understand what the linked pages contain before they visit.</p>
<h3>Why Anchor Text Matters</h3>
<p>Using descriptive and relevant anchor text tells readers and Google what the linked page is about and how it relates to your content. This can improve your site's SEO and make your content more valuable to readers.</p>
<h3>Tips for Using Anchor Text</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use descriptive and relevant anchor text that tells readers and Google what the linked page is about.</li>
<li>Link to high-quality, relevant pages—both internally and externally—that provide more value and information to your readers.</li>
<li>Avoid using too many links or the same links over and over, as this can make your content look unnatural and manipulative.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pro Tip</h3>
<p>Improve your authority and credibility by adding relevant links within the text. Instead of having &quot;click here&quot; links, try writing out the name of the destination. &quot;Click here&quot; has no search engine value beyond the attached URL, whereas &quot;Michigan Tech Enterprise Program&quot; is rich with keywords and will improve your search engine rankings as well as the ranking of the page you are linking to. Always use descriptive links by linking keywords—it not only improves search engine optimization, but also adds value.</p>


<h2>9. Image Optimization</h2>

<p>Optimizing images on your website is crucial for both user experience and SEO. <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/image-seo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Image SEO</a> is the process of making your images more search-engine friendly, so they rank higher in search results. Here are some tips to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduce the image file size</strong> to boost page speed and improve the user experience. Smaller files load faster, which keeps visitors on your site longer.</li>
<li>Choose the appropriate file format for your images based on quality and purpose. JPEGs are great for photos, while PNGs work well for graphics with transparent backgrounds.</li>
<li>Add images to your sitemap to help Google find and index them faster. This can give your images a better chance of appearing in search results.</li>
<li>Use responsive images to ensure they look great on different devices and screen sizes. This is especially important as more people browse the web on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Implement lazy loading to delay the loading of images that aren’t in the user’s view. This can significantly improve your page's load time.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
Remember, optimizing your images not only helps with SEO but also enhances the overall user experience. Faster loading times and better-quality images can make a big difference in how visitors interact with your site.
</blockquote>


<h2>10. Mobile Optimization</h2>

<p>Making sure your website works well on all devices is super important. This means it should look good and function smoothly on tablets, mobiles, and desktops. <strong>A responsive design</strong> can help you rank higher in search results and attract more visitors.</p>
<h3>Test Your Site's Mobile-Friendliness</h3>
<p>You can use tools like Google's Lighthouse to check if your site is mobile-friendly. This will help you find areas that need improvement.</p>
<h3>Optimize Images and Media</h3>
<p>Images and videos can slow down your site if they're not optimized. Make sure to compress them for faster loading times, especially on mobile devices.</p>
<h3>Improve User Experience</h3>
<p>A seamless user experience on smartphones and tablets is key. Make sure your site is easy to navigate and loads quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
Remember, mobile SEO stands for mobile search engine optimization. It's the practice of optimizing your content to achieve a better ranking for your web pages in search results.
