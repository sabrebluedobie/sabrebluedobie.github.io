Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web creation where a website’s layout adjusts smoothly across various screen sizes and devices. The goal is to provide a seamless user experience, whether accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. Key techniques include fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries.</p>

<h3 id="elements-of-responsive-web-design">Elements of Responsive Web Design:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Fluid Grid Layouts</strong>: Use of relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixels to define widths.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexible Images</strong>: Ensuring images scale correctly without compromising the layout.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS Media Queries</strong>: Applying different CSS rules based on the device’s characteristics.</li>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
