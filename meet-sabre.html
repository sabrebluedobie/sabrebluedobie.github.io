    <h2>The Office Manager</h2>
    <p>Sabre's my blue Doberman. He's been with me through every project, every deadline, every debugging session. When I started building websites, he was there. When I almost died from that Shopify project last year, he was there.</p>
    <p>He supervises. He judges. He reminds me to take breaks. This whole company is named after him.</p>

<!-- Journey -->
<section class="section section-alt">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>How He Got Here</h2>
    <p>Born in Oklahoma. Smart from day one. My husband brought him home, and Sabre immediately decided I needed supervision.</p>
    <p>When I started learning web development, Sabre was my constant. Lying on his rug while I figured out JavaScript. Staring at me when I'd been at the computer too long. Being the calm presence when projects got stressful.</p>
    <p>So when I finally launched Bluedobie Developing, there was only one name that made sense.</p>
