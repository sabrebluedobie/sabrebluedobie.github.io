        <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
        <p>I build landing pages, portfolio sites, and simple business websites for solopreneurs and small businesses. Projects under $3k. Fast turnaround. No 6-month timelines.</p>
        <p>I'm based in Princeton, Kentucky, serving Western KY and beyond. You work directly with me - no account managers, no committees, no agency overhead.</p>
        <p>Most projects take 2-4 weeks from start to launch. You get a functional, mobile-friendly site that actually works.</p>

        <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
        <p>My dad taught me DOS as a kid on a computer he built from scratch. We moved around a lot (military family), and technology was the constant. I watched him build things, and I wanted to do the same.</p>
        <p>I'm entirely self-taught. No bootcamp, no CS degree - just figuring things out, breaking things, fixing them. I learned from Google, University of Michigan courses, and years of trial and error.</p>
        <p>Bluedobie Developing is named after my blue Doberman, Sabre. He's been my office companion through every project.</p>

            <p><strong>Want to meet my office manager?</strong><br>
            Sabre's been with me through every project, deadline, and debugging session.</p>

<!-- Philosophy -->
<section class="section section-alt">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why I Do This</h2>
    <div class="quote-block">
      "I love to code and watch projects transform on-screen based on what I enter. The challenges excite me - I enjoy solving problems. Working as a web designer, I can bring ideas to life that otherwise wouldn't exist."
    </div>
    <div class="about-text" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p>Small businesses and solopreneurs get stuck between two bad options: expensive agencies that take months, or cheap template sites that look like everyone else's.</p>
      <p>I'm the middle ground. Custom work at a reasonable price. Fast turnaround without cutting corners. You get a site that works for your specific needs.</p>
      <p>I almost died building a massive Shopify project last year (silent migraines, hospitalized). That's when I restructured everything. No more 6-month builds. Small projects only. Sustainable work that doesn't kill me.</p>
      <p>If you need a small site built right, I'm your person.</p>
