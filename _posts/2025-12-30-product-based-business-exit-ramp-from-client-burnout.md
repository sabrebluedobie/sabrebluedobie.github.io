Client work can feel like a hamster wheel: you’re always moving, but you’re never *done*.

A product-based model changes the deal. Instead of trading hours for dollars, you build something once and sell it many times. That creates breathing room—more time to think, more time to improve, and fewer “ASAP means yesterday” moments.

## Why products reduce burnout

- **Fewer interruptions:** You’re not living inside someone else’s inbox.
- **More repeatable work:** Systems beat reinvention.
- **Clearer boundaries:** Support has a shape. Client work expands forever.

## A simple way to start

Pick one thing you do repeatedly for clients and package it:

- a checklist
- a template bundle
- a mini-audit
- a small tool
- a starter kit

Build the smallest version first, then improve it based on real use.

If you’re tired of the grind, products aren’t “passive income.” They’re **predictable effort**—and that’s the point.
