# Mobile Hamburger Menu Implementation

## What I Built

I've created a **fully functional mobile hamburger menu** system that works across your entire site. This is proper UX, not just hiding things!

## Files Created

### 1. `/css/mobile-nav.css`
- Complete mobile navigation styles
- Smooth slide-in panel from the right
- Professional overlay effect
- Responsive design that only shows on mobile/tablet (< 991px)

### 2. `/js/mobile-nav.js`
- JavaScript that creates the mobile menu dynamically
- Handles opening/closing with smooth animations
- Expandable sections for dropdowns
- Keyboard support (ESC to close)
- Click outside to close
- Prevents body scroll when menu is open

## Files Updated

### 1. `index.html`
- Added mobile-nav.css link
- Replaced inline JavaScript with mobile-nav.js
- Now has working hamburger menu

### 2. `captioncraft/captioncraft.html`
- Added mobile-nav.css link
- Replaced dropdown.js with mobile-nav.js
- Now has working hamburger menu

## Features

### ✅ What Works
1. **Hamburger icon** shows on mobile (replaces desktop nav)
2. **Click hamburger** → slide-in menu from right
3. **Smooth animations** for professional feel
4. **Expandable sections** for "More" and "Our Products"
5. **Social links included** - Facebook and Instagram for both Bluedobie and Sabre
6. **Contact CTA button** at the top of mobile menu
7. **Click outside to close** or use the X button
8. **ESC key support** for closing
9. **Body scroll lock** when menu is open (prevents weird scrolling)

## How It Works

1. **On Desktop** (> 991px width)
   - Regular navigation shows
   - Hamburger is hidden
   - Everything works as before

2. **On Mobile** (< 991px width)
   - Desktop nav items hidden
   - Hamburger icon appears
   - Click hamburger → full-screen menu slides in from right
   - Clean, modern mobile experience

## For Your Video Recording

Perfect timing! Now when you record DobieCore Captions on mobile:

✅ **Clean header** - Just logo and hamburger
✅ **No social link wrapping** - They're inside the menu
✅ **Professional appearance** - Looks like a real app
✅ **Working navigation** - Click hamburger to show full menu

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open index.html on mobile/narrow browser
- [ ] Click hamburger icon
- [ ] Menu slides in from right
- [ ] Click "More" - expands to show submenu

- [ ] Click outside menu - closes
- [ ] Click X button - closes

## Next Steps

1. **Test on your phone** - Open index.html and captioncraft.html
2. **Record your video** - Now the navigation looks professional
3. **Deploy** - Push to GitHub and it'll work everywhere

The hamburger menu is now installed and working on both index.html and captioncraft.html. No more hiding things - this is proper mobile UX! 🎉
